This repository contains the code and data for a thesis project focused on evaluating the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in forecasting food prices.
The study compares SARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM models using historical food price data and external factors such as inflation and climate conditions.
The models were evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and visual analysis. The LSTM model demonstrated the best performance when using all available features, including external factors.
